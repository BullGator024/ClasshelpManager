# ClasshelpManager
<h3>Current version: v0.1 (Beta)</h3>
<p>The class help manager was made with CCBM in mind and it might or might not work with other mods</p>

<p>Data has to be added manually to the MENUDEF file as this does not have an "Add Class" option (yet anyway).</p>
<strong>Python 3.7+ is needed, as well as the library pyqt5 for python.</strong>
<strong>How to use: </strong>
<ol>
  <li>Manually write the file FULL path on the top bar.</li>
  <li>Press open.</li>
  <li>Scroll through the class index.</li>
  <li>Make your changes.</li>
  <li>Press the button "Change".</li>
  <li>Press "Export".</li>
  <li>All done. Any error should be printed in the console.</li>
 </ol>
